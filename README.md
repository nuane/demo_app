demo app for rails tutorial

Gosh golly gee whiz!!! I made this for an online Ruby class I took at City College of San Francisco (the only City College in California,
which puts City College before the city). Best CSC course I took, got an A, not much to say. Hey learned a little Ruby on Rails :)
